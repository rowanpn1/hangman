	<h1>How to Play Hangman</h1>
	<p>Hangman is a guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player(s) try to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game starts with a blank space for each letter of the word. The guessing player(s) suggest letters, and for each correct guess, the spaces are filled in with the letter. For each incorrect guess, a body part of a hangman is drawn. If the full hangman is drawn before the word is guessed, the guessing player(s) lose.</p>
	<p>In this web app version of Hangman, the game will randomly select a word from a collection of submitted words. The user will be presented with a blank space for each letter of the word, and they can guess letters until they either guess the word correctly or the full hangman is drawn.</p>
